# purescript-quaternions

[Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are a generalization of
complex numbers, which turn out to have a few applications in computing.

This library provides a Quaternion data type and some functions for
manipulating them, together with another type for using them to represent
rotations in 3D space.

Documentation is on [Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-quaternions).
